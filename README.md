## Your program must
- Accept problem instances on the command line.
- Name the output file as the input fileâ€™s name with .tour appended (for example input tsp_example_1.txt will output tsp_example_1.txt.tour).
- Compile/Execute correctly and without debugging on the flip server according to specifications and any documentation you provide

## Input specifications
- A problem instance will always be given to you as a text file
- Each line defines a city and each line has three numbers separated by a white space

 - The first number is a city identifier
 - The second number is the city's x-coordinate
 - The third number is the city's y-corrdinate

## Output specifications

- You must output your solution int oanother text file with n+1 lines, where n is the number of cities.
- The first line is the length of the tour your program computes.
- The next n lines should contain the citiy identifier in the order they are visited by your tour.

- Each city must be listed exactly once in this list.
- This is the certificate for your solution and your solutions will be checked. I they are not valid you will not receive credit for them.
