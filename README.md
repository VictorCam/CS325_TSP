## Your program must
- Accept problem instances on the command line.
- Name the output file as the input fileâ€™s name with .tour appended (for example input tsp_example_1.txt will output tsp_example_1.txt.tour).

- Each line defines a city and each line has three numbers separated by a white space

 - The first number is a city identifier
 - The second number is the city's x-coordinate
 - The third number is the city's y-corrdinate
